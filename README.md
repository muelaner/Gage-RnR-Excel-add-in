# Gage-RnR-Excel-add-in
Excel plug-in to perform a Gage R&amp;R ANOVA crossed study.

While advising manufacturers about quality and metrology, I found that a lot of people were buying expensive statistical software such as Minitab when all they wanted to do was run a gage R&R study. This cost a lot of money and wasted their time learning to use complex software. Since most people are comfortable using Excel, I decided to create a simple plugin.
